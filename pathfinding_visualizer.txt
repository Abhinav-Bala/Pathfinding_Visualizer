Programming Language: Python 3.9.1

Programming Description: This program will start by displaying the title screen and 
instructions on how to use the program. A general description of the pathfinding algorithm will
also be given with an option to learn more by reading another article. Then, the user will be
presented with a 40x60 grid where they can first change the position of the starting node. Then,
the user will be able to customize the ending node and then finally place walls along the grid 
area. A wall is a node that the alogrithm can not consider when determining the shortest path.
Finally, the user will confirm their selection and then watch the program try to find the shortest
path. If there is a valid solution, the program will display the path by highlighting it in a 
different color. If no valid path is found, the program will stop and wait for the user to reset
the grid or exit the program. 

Program Assumptions: This program assumes that the user has already installed the latest version of
python and pygame. In order to have the best visualization, the user is reccomended to add walls
to force the program to take obscure routes. Additionally, the program assumes the user understands
how the A* Pathfinding algorithm works.Lastly, fluency of English is another assumption because all 
the instructions are given in English.

Features of the Program: In order to provide an appealing

Restrictions: Once a game mode has been selected, the player must play the game until
they run out of lives before being prompted to switch to a different mode.

Known Errors: N/A
